**Description**: Integrated circuits and hardware intellectual properties (IPs) might provide device configuration controls that need to be programmed after device power reset by a trusted firmware or software module, commonly set by BIOS/bootloader. After reset, there can be an expectation that the controls cannot be used to perform any further modification. This behavior is commonly implemented using a trusted lock bit, which can be set to disable writes to a protected set of registers or address regions. The lock protection is intended to prevent modification of certain system configuration (e.g., memory/memory protection unit configuration). However, if the lock bit does not effectively write-protect all system registers or controls that could modify the protected system configuration, then an adversary may be able to use software to access the registers/controls and modify the protected hardware configuration.
**Extended Description**: ::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:284:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:667:VIEW ID:1000::
**Detection Methods**: ::PHASE:Architecture and Design Implementation Testing:DESCRIPTION:Security lock bit protections must be reviewed for design inconsistency and common weaknesses. Security lock programming flow and lock properties must be tested in pre-silicon and post-silicon testing.::
**Potential Mitigations**: ::REFERENCE:CVE-2018-9085:DESCRIPTION:Certain servers leave a write protection lock bit unset after boot, potentially allowing modification of parts of flash memory.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2018-9085::REFERENCE:CVE-2014-8273:DESCRIPTION:Chain: chipset has a race condition (CWE-362) between when an interrupt handler detects an attempt to write-enable the BIOS (in violation of the lock bit), and when the handler resets the write-enable bit back to 0, allowing attackers to issue BIOS writes during the timing window [REF-1237].:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-8273::
