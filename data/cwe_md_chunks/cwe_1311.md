**Description**: A System or System-on-Chip (SoC) that implements a boot process utilizing security mechanisms such as Root-of-Trust (RoT) typically starts by executing code from a Read-only-Memory (ROM) component. The code in ROM is immutable, hence any security vulnerabilities discovered in the ROM code can never be fixed for the systems that are already in use. A common weakness is that the ROM does not have the ability to patch if security vulnerabilities are uncovered after the system gets shipped. This leaves the system in a vulnerable state where an adversary can compromise the SoC.
**Extended Description**: ::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1329:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::
**Detection Methods**: ::PHASE:Architecture and Design Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Secure patch support to allow ROM code to be patched on the next boot.:EFFECTIVENESS:Moderate::PHASE:Architecture and Design Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Support patches that can be programmed in-field or during manufacturing through hardware fuses. This feature can be used for limited patching of devices after shipping, or for the next batch of silicon devices manufactured, without changing the full device ROM.:EFFECTIVENESS:Moderate::
**Potential Mitigations**: N/A
