**Description**: Security sensitive values, keys, intermediate steps of cryptographic operations, etc. are stored in temporary registers in the hardware. If these values are not cleared when debug mode is entered they may be accessed by a debugger allowing sensitive information to be accessible by untrusted parties.
**Extended Description**: ::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:212:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:200:VIEW ID:1000::
**Detection Methods**: ::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Whenever debug mode is enabled, all registers containing sensitive assets must be cleared.::
