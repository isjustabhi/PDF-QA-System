**Description**: Without the ability to patch or update firmware, consumers will be left vulnerable to exploitation of any known vulnerabilities, or any vulnerabilities that are discovered in the future. This can expose consumers to permanent risk throughout the entire lifetime of the device, which could be years or decades. Some external protective measures and mitigations might be employed to aid in preventing or reducing the risk of malicious attack, but the root weakness cannot be corrected.
**Extended Description**: ::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:1329:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::
**Detection Methods**: ::PHASE:Requirements:DESCRIPTION:Specify requirements to include the ability to update the firmware. Include integrity checks and authentication to ensure that untrusted firmware cannot be installed.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Design the device to allow for updating the firmware. Ensure that the design specifies how to distribute the updates and ensure their integrity and authentication.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Implement the necessary functionality to allow the firmware to be updated.::
**Potential Mitigations**: ::REFERENCE:CVE-2020-9054:DESCRIPTION:Chain: network-attached storage (NAS) device has a critical OS command injection (CWE-78) vulnerability that is actively exploited to place IoT devices into a botnet, but some products are end-of-support and cannot be patched (CWE-1277). [REF-1097]:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-9054::REFERENCE:[REF-1095]:DESCRIPTION:A hardware smart lock has weak key generation that allows attackers to steal the key by BLE sniffing, but the device's firmware cannot be upgraded and hence remains vulnerable [REF-1095].:LINK:https://www.theregister.com/2019/12/11/f_secure_keywe/::
