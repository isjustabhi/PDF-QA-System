**Description**: N/A
**Extended Description**: ::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:311:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:311:VIEW ID:1003:ORDINAL:Primary::
**Detection Methods**: ::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Before transmitting, encrypt the data using reliable, confidentiality-protecting cryptographic protocols.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:When using web applications with SSL, use SSL for the entire session from login to logout, not just for the initial login page.::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:When designing hardware platforms, ensure that approved encryption algorithms (such as those recommended by NIST) protect paths from security critical data to trusted user applications.::PHASE:Testing:DESCRIPTION:Use tools and techniques that require manual (human) analysis, such as penetration testing, threat modeling, and interactive tools that allow the tester to record and modify an active session. These may be more effective than strictly automated techniques. This is especially the case with weaknesses that are related to design and business rules.::PHASE:Operation:DESCRIPTION:Configure servers to use encrypted channels for communication, which may include SSL or other secure protocols.::
