**Description**: Devices may allow device configuration controls which need to be programmed after device power reset via a trusted firmware or software module (commonly set by BIOS/bootloader) and then locked from any further modification. This action is commonly implemented using a programmable lock bit, which, when set, disables writes to a protected set of registers or address regions. After a power state transition, the lock bit is set to unlocked. Some common weaknesses that can exist in such a protection scheme are that the lock gets cleared, the values of the protected registers get reset, or the lock become programmable.
**Extended Description**: ::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:667:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::
**Detection Methods**: ::PHASE:Architecture and Design Implementation Testing:DESCRIPTION:Security Lock bit protections should be reviewed for behavior across supported power state transitions. Security lock programming flow and lock properties should be tested in pre-silicon and post-silicon testing including testing across power transitions.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::
