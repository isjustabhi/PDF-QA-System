**Description**: Debug authorization can have multiple levels of access, defined such that different system internal assets are accessible based on the current authorized debug level. Other than debugger authentication (e.g., using passwords or challenges), the authorization can also be based on the system state or boot stage. For example, full system debug access might only be allowed early in boot after a system reset to ensure that previous session data is not accessible to the authenticated debugger. If this protection mechanism does not ensure that internal assets have the correct debug access level during each boot stage or change in system state, an attacker could obtain sensitive information from the internal asset using a debugger.
**Extended Description**: ::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:863:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::
**Detection Methods**: ::PHASE:Architecture and Design Implementation:DESCRIPTION:For security-sensitive assets accessible over debug/test interfaces, only allow trusted agents.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Apply blinding [REF-1219] or masking techniques in strategic areas.:EFFECTIVENESS:Limited::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Add shielding or tamper-resistant protections to the device, which increases the difficulty and cost for accessing debug/test interfaces.:EFFECTIVENESS:Limited::
**Potential Mitigations**: ::REFERENCE:CVE-2019-18827:DESCRIPTION:After ROM code execution, JTAG access is disabled. But before the ROM code is executed, JTAG access is possible, allowing a user full system access. This allows a user to modify the boot flow and successfully bypass the secure-boot process.:LINK:https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-18827::
