**Description**: Comparison logic is used to compare a variety of objects including passwords, Message Authentication Codes (MACs), and responses to verification challenges. When comparison logic is implemented at a finer granularity (e.g., byte-by-byte comparison) and breaks in the case of a comparison failure, an attacker can exploit this implementation to identify when exactly the failure occurred. With multiple attempts, the attacker may be able to guesses the correct password/response to challenge and elevate their privileges.
**Extended Description**: ::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:208:VIEW ID:1000:ORDINAL:Primary::NATURE:ChildOf:CWE ID:697:VIEW ID:1000::
**Detection Methods**: ::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:The hardware designer should ensure that comparison logic is implemented so as to compare in one operation instead in smaller chunks.::
