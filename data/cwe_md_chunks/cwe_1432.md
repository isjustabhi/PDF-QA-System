**Detection Methods**: ::PHASE:Architecture and Design:DESCRIPTION:Designers/developers should add or modify existing control flow logic along any data flow paths that connect sources (signals with intermediate cryptographic state/results) with sinks (hardware module outputs and other signals outside of trusted cryptographic zone). The control flow logic should only allow cryptographic results to be driven to sinks when appropriate conditions are satisfied (typically when the final result for a cryptographic operation has been generated). When the appropriate conditions are not satisfied (i.e., before or during a cryptographic operation), the control flow logic should drive a safe default value to sinks.:EFFECTIVENESS:High::PHASE:Implementation:DESCRIPTION:Designers/developers should add or modify existing control flow logic along any data flow paths that connect sources (signals with intermediate cryptographic state/results) with sinks (hardware module outputs and other signals outside of trusted cryptographic zone).
